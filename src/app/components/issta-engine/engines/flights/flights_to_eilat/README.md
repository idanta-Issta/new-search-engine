# Flights to Eilat Engine

This folder contains a stub component for the `FLIGHTS_TO_EILAT` engine. Currently the engine uses the standard flights inputs from config. If a custom UI is required, implement it in `flights_to_eilat.component.ts` and set `customInputsComponent` in `FLIGHTS_TO_EILAT_CONFIG` to load this component.
